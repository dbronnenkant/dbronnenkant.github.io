            <p class="p1 w3-large">Hi, my name is Drew Bronnenkant. I am currently learning web development at coder camps. After years of having many different "jobs", I've finally taken the first steps towards having a career. I've been very interested in computers for quite some time, and I'm so excited to be finally doing something about it! I never would have made it to this point if it wasn't for my friend Brandon Corallo, who got me started as a locksmith.</p>
            <p class="p1 w3-large">So about 3 years ago, my friend Brandon started coming up to me and showing me how he could pick locks. He would pick the padlock off a shed, or pick the door lock that lead somewhere we weren't supposed to go. We never actually went inside, he was just showing me that he could do it. Although I thought it was pretty cool, I wasn't all that interested. But Brandon kept on me, and after another year had gone by, where I had worked at 2 different sushi bars, he told me how much he was making. He was making in a day what I was making in a week! He certainly had my attention.</p>
            <p class="p1 w3-large">I decided to go on a ride along with him. We met a customer who was locked out of his house at about 10pm and Brandon asked if it was alright if his new trainee Drew picked the lock for him. The customer agreed and I went to work. When that cylinder turned, and the door opened, even though there was no key, that was it. I WAS HOOKED!</p>
            <p class="p1 w3-large">I spent roughly the next two years years running my own locksmith business with great success. I learned that I truly enjoy problem solving. It's an amazing feeling when you come up against a problem, and are able to defeat it. It's what gave me the courage to take this step towards becoming a web developer. I never would have been able to do this were it not for my experience as a locksmith. I am forever grateful for my friend Brandon who was always there to help me no matter what time of night I called him. He is the most patient and generous teacher I've ever had, and one of my best friends.
